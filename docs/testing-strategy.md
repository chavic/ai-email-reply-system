# Testing Strategy

This document outlines the comprehensive testing approach for the AI Email Reply System, following the testing pyramid model with a focus on thorough test coverage at all levels.

## Testing Pyramid

Our testing strategy follows the classic testing pyramid:

1. **Unit Tests** (Base Layer): Fast, isolated tests for individual components
2. **Integration Tests** (Middle Layer): Testing interactions between components
3. **End-to-End Tests** (Top Layer): Testing the complete system behavior

## Unit Tests

Unit tests focus on testing individual components in isolation by mocking dependencies.

### Coverage Areas:

- **Services**: Testing core business logic in isolation
  - OpenAI service (AI reply generation)
  - Microsoft Graph service (email operations)
  - Firebase service (data storage)
  
- **Routes**: Testing API endpoints with mocked services
  - Auth routes (OAuth flows)
  - Email routes (email operations)
  - AI routes (reply generation)

### Tools:
- Jest for test runner and assertions
- Mocks for external dependencies

### Running Unit Tests:
```
npm run test:unit
```

## Integration Tests

Integration tests verify that different parts of the system work together correctly.

### Coverage Areas:

- **API Integration**: Testing API endpoints with real service interactions
  - Authentication flows
  - Email operations
  - AI reply generation
  
- **Firebase Integration**: Testing database operations
  - User token storage and retrieval
  - Logging email interactions
  - User preferences management

### Tools:
- Jest for test runner
- Supertest for API testing
- Firebase emulator for database testing

### Running Integration Tests:
```
npm run test:integration
```

## End-to-End Tests

E2E tests verify the complete system behavior from the user's perspective.

### Coverage Areas:

- **API E2E**: Testing the deployed API endpoints
  - Complete authentication flow
  - Email operations with real accounts
  - AI reply generation with real data
  
- **Outlook Add-In**: Testing the user interface
  - Add-In loading and initialization
  - Office.js integration
  - Reply generation workflow

### Tools:
- Jest for test runner
- Axios for API requests
- Puppeteer for browser automation

### Running E2E Tests:
```
npm run test:e2e
```

## Test Environment Management

### Local Development:
- Unit tests use in-memory mocks
- Integration tests use local emulators when possible
- E2E tests require credentials but can target local endpoints

### CI/CD Pipeline:
- Unit and Integration tests run on every pull request
- E2E tests run on staging environment before production deployment
- Coverage reports generated and tracked

## Code Coverage

We maintain high test coverage across the codebase:

- Target: 70% overall code coverage
- Higher coverage for critical components (80%+)
- Coverage reports generated with:
  ```
  npm run test:coverage
  ```

## Manual Testing

In addition to automated tests, we perform manual testing for:

- UX validation
- Performance verification
- Security checks
- Accessibility testing

## Continuous Improvement

The testing strategy is not static:

1. We regularly review test coverage and failure patterns
2. We update tests to match new features and changes
3. We improve test speed and reliability
4. We automate manual tests when possible

## Pre-deployment Checklist

Before releasing a new version:

1. All unit and integration tests pass
2. E2E tests pass on staging environment
3. Code coverage meets targets
4. Manual testing confirms functionality
5. Performance meets 1-second latency requirement
